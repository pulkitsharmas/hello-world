You must be tangled with the indentations and the tags. Feeling painful, huh? But believe me, you can make it.

Remember the first day when you just landed with your first static web page, that you created for your cat and it's pictures.
Yes! that's right you just need that **enthusiasm** back!
Bring back the confidence
There are ups and downs in life. But running away was never an option.
The Developer Mindset is what you need to develop. 
There are phases in a developers life where he starts with learning from scratch. He learns all the basic syntax and works around. And the confidence builds up. But sooner or later, when he finds himself in middle of problems. All the confidence is washed off. This is where people give up. But **YOU WILL NOT**. 
I am here to help you out. And Guess what! you can believe me because I am you only.
So, lets start off with some basic techniques:
*  Get Some Sleep! at first. It really works, you might see what wasn't clear all these days.
*  Ask for help! It's good to ask for help. Community is there to help you. And believe me it's not only us. There are other people like us present.
*  Search over Internet.
* Read and Go through Fundamentals
> You are not wrong it's just you are not right yet.

###Don't Give up!
Perseverance pays off. Relax. You can do it.
